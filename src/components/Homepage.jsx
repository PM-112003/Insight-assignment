                    Welcome to the senior survey* website where we present the findings of the senior survey conducted among IITB's graduating batch of 2024. 
                    The survey gathers valuable insights from the outgoing batch. The survey is divided into four key sections: Academics, Career, Personal and Miscellaneous. 
                    We have also included some comments about their time and experiences here at IITB at the end of the Miscellaneous section.
                </p>
